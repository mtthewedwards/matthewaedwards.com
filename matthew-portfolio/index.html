    		  <p>	This website was my final Project from my HTML & CSS Skillcrush Course. I was given a design template from a previously created website, and I recreated the same website with HTML & CSS. Afterwards I put it online.</p>

    			<p> I originally started taking an interest in computer science in college. I watched Harvard and MIT lectures, and self-taught myself how to code. Today, I work as an actor and a performer at Disneyland, but I never lost my interest in the tech industry. Now, I hope to bring my two passions, art and technology, into one. I am now embarking on a journey through skillcrush to learn web development and UI/UX design. These days, you can usually find me in Los Angeles acting, coding in a coffee shop in Whittier, playing frisbee in Fullerton, or performing at Disneyland!</p>
